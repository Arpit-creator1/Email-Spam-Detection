Spam Detection System Overview

The Spam Detection System is a Machine Learning–based application that classifies text messages or emails as Spam or Not Spam (Ham). It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess text data and a trained ML model to make accurate predictions.

This project demonstrates the practical application of Text Classification, Feature Extraction, and Supervised Learning.
